          <dd>This website is packed with tools to help you with solving Systems of Equations, performing opertions on matrices, calculating determinates, Vector spaces, and performing linear transformations.</dd>
          <dd>Some common things you might find useful is the row operation calculator and/or transforming a matrix into row/reduced row echolen form.</dd>
          <dd>Shows comprehensible steps.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://ncalculators.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nCalculators.com</a></dt>
          <dd>You have probably already come across this site before. Essentially, it has calculators for just about every science course that relates to computers.</dd>
          <dd>You can even search up the topic/calculator your looking for and will most likely find it.</dd>
          <dd>Shows full steps with your input.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/linear.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linear Diophantine Equations Calc.</a></dt>
          <dd>The most simple calculator I have ever found for solving Linear Diophantine Equations.</dd>
          <dd>Shows full steps with your input.</dd>
          <dt><a href ="https://www.symbolab.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symbolab.com</a></dt>
          <dd>You may have already used this. Essentially, it's an all-in-one for solving problems.</dd>
          <dd>99% of the time it will be able to solve whatever type of problem you want.</dd>
          <dd>Shows full steps with your input.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://math.typeit.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type Mathematical Symbols - Online Keyboard</a></dt>
          <dd>Extremly simple online tool that allows you to copy mathematical eqautions/symbols that you need in text form.</dd>
          <dd>For the people that use Quizlet (or any other online input that only accepts text), this will allow you type out your statements and paste them in seamlessly, without having to worry about loosing basic formatting.</dd>
          <dd>For instance, try making an eqaution in MS Word and then pasting it into Quizlet, you will loose all formatting. However, this tool will allow you to do just that.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://smalltext.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Text Generator</a></dt>
          <dd>For the same reasons above, some websites don't allow super/subscript text.</dd>
          <dd>However, this website will convert whatever you type in into small or superscript text that is compatible with such websites.</dd>
          <dd>So if you have super/subscript variables in your equation/definition, type the characters you need into this website and paste the result wherever you need it.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://www.dcode.fr/modulo-n-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modulo Calculator</a></dt>
          <dd>As the name implies, its a mod calculator.</dd>
          <dd>A simple website for your quick mod calculations</dd>
          <dd>Unfortunately, there are no steps given with your input.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/19sp/resources/math/summation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summation Identities</a></dt>
          <dd>Has your professor decided to provide you with only a few summation identities?</dd>
          <dd>Has your professor decided to scramble the summation identities throughout their notes/lectures?</dd>
          <dd>If so, here is a website that has all the identies you should need, presented very nicely.</dd>
          <dd>You can also download them all as a pdf.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://quickmath.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickMath.com</a></dt>
          <dd>If symbolab and wolfram can't compute your equation, QuickMath.com probably can.</dd>
          <dd>If your looking for systems of equations, click the "advanced" tab under "eqautions".</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://www.erpelstolz.at/gateway/formular-uk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logic Calculator</a></dt>
          <dd>This calculator is able to validate logical proofs and create truth tables based on your logic statment input.</dd>
          <dd>Head over to "Server Side Functions" to find a vast number of tasks that can be performed.</dd>
          <dd>This will provide you with truth tables, transformations, different notations, proofs (with steps from input), and tautology checks.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "http://www.algolist.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algolist.net</a></dt>
          <dd>For those of you in an algorithms and data structures course, this is a website that clearly explains the concepts you are studying in a much more comprehensible way than most professors.</dd>
          <dd>It goes over all types of data structures and their opertions; Arrays and strings, Binary Heaps, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), Hash Tables etc.</dd>
          <dt><a href ="http://www.cs.bu.edu/~snyder/cs112/CourseMaterials/LinkedListNotes.Iteration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linked Lists and Iterative Algorithms</a> and <a href = "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/linked%20lists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linked Lists</a></dt>
          <dd>Both of these I found extremely helpful with understanding the "Linked List" concept/data structure.</dd>
          <dd>Essentially, they talk about the same thing and give great coding exmaples.</dd>

          <dd>I had this saved for some reason so it was apparently helpful to me at some point.</dd>
          <dd>Essentially, this gives an exmaple of a recursive solution to computing an array of numbers who's sum adds up to a given number.</dd>
          <dt><a href = "https://circuitverse.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Logic Circuit Simulator</a></dt>
          <dd>For those in a computer hardware course, here is your answer.</dd>
          <dd>It allows you to make whatever circuit you need and test with various input signals (i.e. 1 or 0).</dd>
          <dd>This website is completely free and extremely easy to use.</dd>
          <dt><a href ="https://graphonline.ru/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Graph / Algorithm Visualizer</a></dt>
          <dd>This allows you to create the graphs you see in class, and step through each itteration of the algorithm of your choice.</dd>
          <dd>It includes; Breath-first search (BFS), Depth-first search (DFS), Eulerian cycles/paths, Hamiltonian cycles/paths, vertice degree calculator, etc.</dd>
          <dd>This will be a huge help to further your understanding such algorithms.</dd>

          <dd>Welcome to the mother of all algorithm visualizers. This takes algorithm visualization to another level.</dd>
          <dd>This website has a vast selection of algorithms and pre-made (while editable as well) code to go with them.</dd>
          <dd>Much like the previous link, but more complex.</dd>
