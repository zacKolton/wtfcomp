Web Tools For comp

WTFcomp stands for Web Tools For comp, computer science, that is. If you are like me, an average student in computer science, the phrase WTF may be a common one for you. It seemed fitting to name this site with, arguably, the most common phrase among all cs studnets. <br><br>Essentially WTFcomp is a compiled list of online tools that I have used throughout my entire degree for assignments and/or projects.<br><br>Eventually, it will be composed entirely of mini web apps, persay, for you to utilize locally on this website (rather than linking to multiple other websites). However, if I cannot recreate a tool, it will be left in the resources section.<br></br>Aside, this will also contain small tutorials explained in a simple and understandable manner, so that you do not have to search all over the internet to find them.
