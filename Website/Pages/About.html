            <p>My name is Zac Kolton, currently 21 years old and studying computer science at the University of Manitoba.<br><br>I enjoy creating new things and passing that information on for the "next guy", hence this entire website.<br><br>I love cinema with original ideas, science fiction, my dog Tucker, and people that are optimistic.<br><br>Surprisingly, I have a lovely girlfriend, and we have been going strong ever since the very first day we met. I have learnt more about life in general from her than I could have ever imagined. If anything, I hope my fellow "geeks" can use this as inspiration.<br><br>I hope you find this website helpful, if you think it can be improved (which it most defintely can), shoot me an email at zac.kolton@hotmail.com.</p>

            <p>WTFcomp stands for Web Tools For comp, computer science, that is. If you are like me, an average student in computer science, the phrase WTF may be a common one for you. It seemed fitting to name this site with, arguably, the most common phrase among all cs studnets. <br><br>Essentially WTFcomp is a compiled list of online tools that I have used throughout my entire degree for assignments and/or projects.<br><br>Eventually, it will be composed entirely of mini web apps, persay, for you to utilize locally on this website (rather than linking to multiple other websites). However, if I cannot recreate a tool, it will be left in the resources section.<br></br>Aside, this will also contain small tutorials explained in a simple and understandable manner, so that you do not have to search all over the internet to find them.

          <div class="aboutDescription">
            <p>Throughout my degree and personal projects, I have always needed to go to multiple websites for online tools and explanations to piece together whatever I am working on.<br><br>I suspect there are others like me, being an average student.<br><br>So I got pissed off and decided to create this website so future cs students didn't have to share this same pain with me and others alike.<br><br>Additionally, I was unable to find a single site that didn't mention "chegg.com" as a online tool for cs students. Leading me to believe there is a lack of websites that compile a generalized version of online cs tools and that also understand what an online cs tool actually means / stands for:<br><br>Free,<br>Simple Input / Output format, and an<br>Understandable User Interface</p>

            <p>The idea conjured up in early 2020, and the initial commit was made (to GitHub) on November 7th, 2020. However, I would argue this idea was always floating around ever since I started a google doc named "Helpful Links" towards the end of my first year at the U of M.<br><br>Where? ... does this really matter? Might as well add it for that SEO.<br><br>I started this in East St. Paul, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. For those living outside Canada, we do not live in igloos, if thats still somehow a common misconception.</p>
